The TemperatureBlanket application was written for knitting influencer @nessinwolland to track and update progress of a temperature blanket.

The homepage shows a table with the days of 2024 where the user can add the temperature and/or update the day if it has been knitted.
The last day of each month is mentioned twice, reason therefore is that between months there should be a white row as seperation. So the "first" last day has its color based on temperature and the "second" last day is default white.
The homepage also has some filters shown as buttons and a searchfield.

The second page acts as a preview of the blanket, this page also contains some filters shown as buttons and a searchfield like the homepage.

When using the searchfield it is important to use | as seperator between two dates otherwise the result will be an empty list.

I am a starting developer and this is my first public project, thank you for your time and any feedback is greatly appreciated.
